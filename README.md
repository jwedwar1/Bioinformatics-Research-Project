# Bioinformatics-Research-Project
This project is a work in progress. The R scripts work to generate a random landscape of habitable and uninhabitable sites for mosquitoes to lay eggs. The landscape is then populated with mosquitoes who have preset characteristics such as remaining time alive, judgment on if a site is suitable to lay eggs, and depth of memory. A simulation is run on how the mosquitoes behave with regards to laying their eggs. The mosquitoes will either exhibit patterns of compression or contagion when it comes to habitat selection. This project seeks to determine what combinations of environmental and evolutionary factors lead to each.
